**SailPoint Automation Toolkit**
Overview

This project demonstrates automation techniques used to improve efficiency and scalability in Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) environments.

The focus is on scripting, API integrations, and workflow automation to reduce manual operational effort and improve reliability of identity processes.

Problem

IAM environments often face operational challenges:

Manual bulk updates and tagging

Time-consuming provisioning workflows

Repetitive ServiceNow ticket operations

Limited automation for identity lifecycle tasks

These activities can slow down operations and increase error rates.

Solution

Automation workflows and scripts were developed to:

Perform bulk tagging of identities, roles, and access profiles

Automate ticket creation and updates

Integrate with REST APIs

Improve lifecycle workflow efficiency

Standardize operational procedures
